# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

## Overview

This system implements an intelligent document analysis pipeline that extracts and prioritizes relevant sections from a collection of PDF documents based on a specific persona and job-to-be-done. The approach combines traditional NLP techniques with modern semantic similarity to achieve accurate relevance scoring while meeting strict performance constraints.

## Methodology

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

The system employs a multi-stage processing pipeline:

**Stage 1: Text Extraction**
- Uses PyPDF2 for robust PDF text extraction
- Implements intelligent section detection using regex patterns
- Handles various document formats (academic papers, reports, textbooks)
- Extracts both section titles and content for comprehensive analysis

**Stage 2: Section Identification**
- Identifies document sections using multiple pattern matching strategies:
  - ALL CAPS titles (common in reports and papers)
  - Numbered sections (1. Introduction, 2. Methods, etc.)
  - Title case headers (Chapter 1, Section A, etc.)
  - Chapter and section markers
- Creates hierarchical structure with sections and subsections

**Stage 3: Semantic Analysis**
- Uses Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic encoding
- Model selection rationale: ~90MB size, excellent performance, CPU-optimized
- Encodes both persona+job context and document content
- Calculates cosine similarity for relevance scoring

### 2. Relevance Scoring Algorithm

The scoring system employs a weighted approach:

**Context Encoding:**
- Combines persona and job description into unified context
- Example: "Investment Analyst: Analyze revenue trends, R&D investments, and market positioning strategies"

**Multi-level Scoring:**
- Section Title Score (70% weight): Captures high-level relevance
- Content Score (30% weight): Captures detailed content relevance
- Final Score = (Title Score × 0.7) + (Content Score × 0.3)

**Subsection Analysis:**
- Extracts subsections using common indicators (numbered lists, bullet points, etc.)
- Applies same semantic scoring to individual subsections
- Ranks subsections within each section

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Model Efficiency:**
- Selected all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (90MB) to meet 1GB constraint
- CPU-only operation with no GPU dependencies
- Optimized batch processing for multiple documents

**Processing Speed:**
- Efficient text preprocessing and section detection
- Parallel processing where possible
- Early termination for low-relevance sections
- Target: <60 seconds for 3-5 documents

**Memory Management:**
- Streaming text processing for large documents
- Efficient data structures for section storage
- Minimal memory footprint for embeddings

### 4. Output Structure

The system generates structured JSON output with three main components:

**Metadata:**
- Input document list
- Persona and job specifications
- Processing timestamp for reproducibility

**Extracted Section:**
- Top-ranked section with document source
- Page number and section title
- Importance rank (0.0-1.0 scale)

**Sub-section Analysis:**
- Most relevant subsection from top section
- Refined text content
- Page number constraints

## Technical Constraints Compliance

**CPU-Only Operation:** ✅
- No GPU dependencies in code or dependencies
- Optimized for CPU processing

**Model Size ≤ 1GB:** ✅
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2: ~90MB
- Total system footprint: <200MB

**Processing Time ≤ 60 seconds:** ✅
- Optimized pipeline for 3-5 documents
- Efficient text processing and scoring
- Parallel processing where beneficial

**No Internet Access:** ✅
- All models downloaded during Docker build
- Completely offline operation
- No external API calls

## Generalization Capability

The system is designed to handle diverse document types and personas:

**Document Types:**
- Academic papers and research documents
- Financial reports and annual statements
- Educational textbooks and course materials
- Technical documentation and manuals

**Persona Types:**
- Researchers and academics
- Business analysts and investors
- Students and educators
- Journalists and content creators

**Job Types:**
- Literature reviews and research synthesis

- Content summarization and extraction

## Quality Assurance

**Robust Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of malformed PDFs
- Fallback mechanisms for text extraction
- Comprehensive input validation

**Scalability:**
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Configurable parameters for different use cases
- Efficient processing for larger document collections

**Reproducibility:**
